# DataWrangling-TwitterApi-Analysis
This is a project I did for the Udacity Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree program for my second project. 
I gathered, assessed, and cleaned the data, then analysed it and presented some visualizations.
The code lies in a jupyter notebook. Descriptive reports and all needed files are in the zip archive.
